# AnyGen Data Analysis (CSV)

> **You MUST strictly follow every instruction in this document.** Do not skip, reorder, or improvise any step.

Analyze CSV data with AnyGen: generate clean tables, summaries, charts, and insights using AnyGen OpenAPI. Output: online task URL for interactive viewing.

## When to Use

- User needs to analyze CSV data (tables, charts, summaries, insights)
- User has data files to upload for analysis

## Security & Permissions

**What this skill does:**
- Sends task prompts and parameters to `www.anygen.io`
- Uploads user-provided data files to `www.anygen.io` after obtaining consent
- Spawns a background process (up to 25 min) to monitor progress
- Reads/writes API key config at `~/.config/anygen/config.json`

**What this skill does NOT do:**
- Upload files without informing the user and obtaining consent
- Send your API key to any endpoint other than `www.anygen.io`
- Modify system configuration beyond `~/.config/anygen/config.json`

**Bundled scripts:** `scripts/anygen.py` (Python — uses `requests`). Review before first use.

## Prerequisites

- Python3 and `requests`: `pip3 install requests`
- AnyGen API Key (`sk-xxx`) — [Get one](https://www.anygen.io/home?auto_create_openclaw_key=1)
- Configure once: `python3 scripts/anygen.py config set api_key "sk-xxx"`

> All `scripts/` paths below are relative to this skill's installation directory.

## CRITICAL: NEVER Block the Conversation

After creating a task, you MUST start background monitoring via `sessions_spawn`, then continue normally. NEVER call `poll` in the foreground — it blocks for up to 20 minutes.

1. `create` → get `task_id` and `task_url`.
2. Tell user: (a) generation started, (b) the online link, (c) ~10–15 min, free to do other things.
3. Launch background monitor via `sessions_spawn` (Phase 4). Do NOT announce this to the user.
4. Continue the conversation — do NOT wait.
5. The background monitor handles notifying the user directly, then replies `ANNOUNCE_SKIP` so the main session does NOT relay anything further.

## Communication Style

**NEVER expose internal implementation details** to the user. Forbidden terms:
- Technical identifiers: `task_id`, `file_token`, `conversation.json`, `task_xxx`, `tk_xxx`
- API/system terms: `API`, `OpenAPI`, `prepare`, `create`, `poll`, `status`, `query`
- Infrastructure terms: `sub-agent`, `subagent`, `background process`, `spawn`, `sessions_spawn`
- Script/code references: `anygen.py`, `scripts/`, command-line syntax, JSON output

Use natural language instead:
- "Your file has been uploaded" (NOT "file_token=tk_xxx received")
- "I'm starting the analysis now" (NOT "Task task_xxx created")
- "You can view the results here: [URL]" (NOT "Task URL: ...")
- "I'll let you know when it's ready" (NOT "Spawning a sub-agent to poll")

Additional rules:
- You may mention AnyGen as the service when relevant.
- Summarize `prepare` responses naturally — do not echo verbatim.
- Stick to the questions `prepare` returned — do not add unrelated ones.
- Ask questions in your own voice, as if they are your own questions. Do NOT use a relaying tone like "AnyGen wants to know…" or "The system is asking…".

## Data Analysis Workflow (MUST Follow All 4 Phases)

### Phase 1: Understand Requirements

If the user provides files, handle them before calling `prepare`:

1. **Read the file** yourself. Extract key information relevant to the analysis (columns, data types, sample rows).
2. **Reuse existing `file_token`** if the same file was already uploaded in this conversation.
3. **Get consent** before uploading: "I'll upload your file to AnyGen for reference. This may take a moment..."
4. **Upload** to get a `file_token`.
5. **Include extracted content** in `--message` when calling `prepare` (the API does NOT read files internally).

```bash
python3 scripts/anygen.py upload --file ./sales_2024.csv
# Output: File Token: tk_abc123

python3 scripts/anygen.py prepare \
  --message "I need to analyze this sales data. Columns: date, product, region, revenue, units. Key content: [extracted summary]" \
  --file-token tk_abc123 \
  --save ./conversation.json
```

Present questions from `reply` naturally. Continue with user's answers:

```bash
python3 scripts/anygen.py prepare \
  --input ./conversation.json \
  --message "Focus on monthly revenue trends by region, and create a chart showing top products" \
  --save ./conversation.json
```

Repeat until `status="ready"` with `suggested_task_params`.

Special cases:
- `status="ready"` on first call → proceed to Phase 2.
- User says "just create it" → skip to Phase 3 with `create` directly.

### Phase 2: Confirm with User (MANDATORY)

When `status="ready"`, summarize the suggested plan (analysis goals, metrics, visualizations) and ask for confirmation. NEVER auto-create without explicit approval.

If the user requests adjustments, call `prepare` again with the modification, re-present, and repeat until approved.

### Phase 3: Create Task

```bash
python3 scripts/anygen.py create \
  --operation data_analysis \
  --prompt "<prompt from suggested_task_params>" \
  --file-token tk_abc123
# Output: Task ID: task_xxx, Task URL: https://...
```

**Immediately tell the user (natural language, NO internal terms):**
1. Analysis is being generated.
2. Online preview/edit link: "You can follow the progress here: [URL]".
3. Takes about **10–15 minutes** — free to do other things, you'll notify when ready.

### Phase 4: Monitor and Deliver Result

> **Requires `sessions_spawn`.** If unavailable, skip to **Fallback** below.

#### Background Monitoring (preferred)

**CRITICAL**: When calling `sessions_spawn`, you MUST set a timeout of at least 25 minutes to ensure the background monitor completes. The poll operation can take up to 20 minutes.

Example spawn call syntax (adjust to match your OpenClaw/sessions API):

```
sessions_spawn(
    prompt=<subagent prompt below>,
    runTimeoutSeconds=1500  # REQUIRED: 25 minutes (1500s) to cover 20-min poll + buffer
)
```

If your sessions API uses different parameter names (e.g., `timeout`, `maxDuration`), use the equivalent parameter to set a 25-minute (1500 second) timeout.

---

**Subagent prompt** (it has NO conversation context):

```
You are a background monitor for a data analysis task.
You MUST strictly follow every instruction below. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise any step.

Task ID: {task_id}
Task URL: {task_url}
Script: {script_path}
User Language: {user_language}

IMPORTANT: This monitoring task may take up to 20 minutes. Ensure your execution timeout is at least 25 minutes.

CRITICAL RULES:
- You MUST reply in {user_language}.
- After completing ALL steps (including sending messages to the user), your FINAL reply
  MUST be EXACTLY "ANNOUNCE_SKIP" — nothing else. This prevents the main session from
  sending duplicate messages.
- Do NOT say anything beyond what is specified below. No greetings, no extra commentary.
- NEVER include technical terms like "task_id", "file_token", "poll", "sub-agent",
  "API", "script", "workspace", "downloaded to", file paths, or status labels
  in any message to the user.

Your job:
1. Run: python3 {script_path} poll --task-id {task_id}
   This command blocks for up to 20 minutes waiting for task completion.
   No --output needed — results are viewed online.

2. On success:
   a. Send a text message to the user (in {user_language}, natural tone):
      "Your data analysis is ready! You can view the charts and results here: {task_url}"
   b. Reply EXACTLY: ANNOUNCE_SKIP

3. On failure:
   a. Send a text message to the user (in {user_language}):
      "Unfortunately the analysis didn't complete successfully.
       You can check the details here: {task_url}"
   b. Reply EXACTLY: ANNOUNCE_SKIP

4. On timeout (20 min):
   a. Send a text message to the user (in {user_language}):
      "The analysis is taking a bit longer than expected.
       You can check the progress here: {task_url}"
   b. Reply EXACTLY: ANNOUNCE_SKIP
```

Do NOT wait for the background monitor. Do NOT tell the user you launched it.

**Handling the completion event.** The background monitor sends the notification to the user directly. It replies `ANNOUNCE_SKIP` as its final output, which means the main session should NOT relay or duplicate any message. If you receive a completion event with `ANNOUNCE_SKIP`, simply ignore it — the user has already been notified.

#### Fallback (no background monitoring)

Tell the user: "I've started the analysis. It usually takes about 10–15 minutes. You can check the progress here: [Task URL]. Let me know when you'd like me to check if it's ready!"
